FarmTech Kenya

Goal: Build a smart, AI-powered platform to help Kenyan farmers manage crops, livestock, assets, finances, and access farming knowledge/resources.

1. Problems Farmers Face

Poor farm data management (land size, livestock records, harvests, etc. are tracked manually or not at all).

Low accountability and planning → farmers don’t know where they lose money.

Lack of access to accurate, localized info (best crops for soil, climate, fertilizers, disease prevention).

Missed vaccinations and animal care schedules.

Limited financial insights (profits, expenditure, budgeting).

Market access challenges (pricing transparency, knowing where to sell produce).

2. Proposed Solution

A farmer profile system that collects and stores structured data about their land, crops, animals, and finances. AI helps with recommendations, disease detection, and planning.

3. Key Features

Farmer Profile & Assets

Land: track acres (planting, homestead, vegetables, trees, etc.)

Livestock: count animals, record births/deaths, vaccinations, milk output.

Smart Agriculture AI Tools

Scan diseased plants → AI suggests diagnosis & solution.

Location-based recommendations (what crops/trees/animals thrive there).

Financial Tracker

Input sales (milk, eggs, harvest produce).

Track expenses (feed, fertilizer, seeds).

Automated monthly/seasonal reports → profit/loss, budgeting.

Crop & Animal Research Database

Interactive library with guides: crops, trees, vegetables, fertilizers, silage, animal care, etc.

Compare fertilizers/inputs and match them to crops.

Notifications & Alerts

Reminders for vaccinations, planting/harvesting timelines, budgeting deadlines.

Market Integration (future expansion)

Connect farmers to buyers, co-ops, and markets.

Track produce sales and prices across regions.

Tech Stack Plan 

Since you want to start simple and scale up:

Phase 1 (Learning & Prototype)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS

Backend: Laravel (PHP, your strength)

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL

Phase 2 (Scalable Web Apps)

Frontend: Vue.js (for dashboards & interactivity)

APIs: Laravel backend with structured endpoints

AI: Start with Python microservices (plant disease detection, outfit recommendation).

Phase 3 (Mobile Expansion)

Flutter / React Native → mobile apps for farmers and fashion community.

Sync with existing backend.

FarmTech Kenya – Modular Breakdown
1. Farmer Profile & Land Management Module

Purpose: Store farmer details and land usage data.

Farmer details (name, contact, location [GPS], ID).

Land size (total acres).

Land allocation:

Homestead/compound.

Planting fields (crop-specific).

Small garden/vegetables.

Trees/orchards.

Database Tables (simplified):

farmers → farmer_id, name, contact, location, etc.

lands → land_id, farmer_id, total_acres, gps_coordinates.

land_usage → usage_id, land_id, crop/usage_type, acres.

2. Crop Management Module

Purpose: Track all crop-related activities.

Crops planted (type, acres, planting date).

Fertilizers/manure used → costs tracked.

Harvest details (bags, units, date).

Sales data (bags sold, price per bag).

Database Tables:

crops → crop_id, land_id, name, planting_date, acres.

crop_inputs → input_id, crop_id, fertilizer/manure, quantity, cost.

harvests → harvest_id, crop_id, quantity, unit, date.

crop_sales → sale_id, harvest_id, quantity_sold, price_per_unit, buyer, total.

3. Livestock Management Module

Purpose: Track animals, health, and productivity.

Domestic animals (cows, goats, chickens, pets).

Animal births/deaths.

Vaccination schedules + reminders.

Milk production tracking.

Sales (milk, eggs, meat, etc.).

Expenses (feed, salt, hay).

Database Tables:

livestock → animal_id, farmer_id, type, breed, birth_date, status.

vaccinations → vax_id, animal_id, vaccine_name, due_date, done_date.

milk_production → record_id, animal_id, liters, date.

livestock_sales → sale_id, animal_id, product (milk/eggs/meat), qty, price, date.

livestock_expenses → expense_id, animal_id, item (feed, salt), cost, date.

4. Financial Management & Budgeting Module

Purpose: Give farmer insights on profits, losses, and budgets.

Track all income from crops + animals.

Track all expenses (inputs, feed, fertilizers).

Monthly & seasonal reports.

Profit/Loss calculations.

Database Tables:

transactions → txn_id, farmer_id, type (income/expense), category (crop/livestock), amount, date.

budgets → budget_id, farmer_id, month, planned_expenses, actual_expenses, notes.

5. Knowledge & Research Module

Purpose: Help farmers research crops, fertilizers, and animal care.

Crop guides (best soil, weather conditions, fertilizers).

Fertilizer/Manure comparison.

Animal care guides (vaccinations, feeds).

Database Tables:

knowledge_base → kb_id, category (crop/livestock), title, content, images, videos.

fertilizer_comparison → fert_id, crop_type, name, best_usage, pros, cons.

6. AI & Smart Assistance Module

Purpose: Use AI to assist farmers.

Plant disease detection (scan image → AI suggests solution).

AI recommendations (best crop/animal for location).

Reminders/alerts (vaccinations, planting, harvesting).

(Here we integrate Python AI microservices that communicate with Laravel API).

7. Market Integration Module (Future Phase)

Purpose: Help farmers sell their produce easily.

Farmers list products for sale (bags of maize, liters of milk).

Buyers can browse and connect.

Pricing history per region.

Database Tables:

market_listings → listing_id, farmer_id, product, qty, price, date.

buyers → buyer_id, name, contact.

sales_history → id, product, price, date, buyer_id.

9. Voice-based Input Module

Purpose: Make the platform farmer-friendly, even for those with limited literacy.

Farmers can log data by speaking:

“I sold 5 bags of maize at 3000 each.”

“Add 1 calf born today.”
